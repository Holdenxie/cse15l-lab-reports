## 'cd' command with no argument
!{Image}(http:

The work directory is home when the command is run with no arguments.
Though the command changes dirctory, but there isn't any input so the directory remains unchange. 
The output is not an error because it started and ended in the same directory 

## 'cd' comamnd with a 'directory' as an argument
