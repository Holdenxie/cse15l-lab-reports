In this, the `handleRequest` method is called. 
The revelent argument for the method is the URL. 
The variable `messages`, `user` and `chat` are changed according to the input. In this case the `message` varible becomes `gradres` and the `user` is `hello`.
Because this is the very first input, chat did not store any other previous input, thus chat is `hello: gradres`.
